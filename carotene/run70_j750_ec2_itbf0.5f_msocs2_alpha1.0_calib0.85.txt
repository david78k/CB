Helping people in times of illness and pain - and celebrating the joy of new life - is both mission and tradition.   In 1885, Sister Mary Wood of the Episcopal Church founded a 9-bed facility that became the Los Angeles Hospital and Home for Invalids. The hospital was renamed Good Samaritan Hospital in 1886 in honor of Mrs. Mark Severance, whose generous donation enabled the hospital to move to larger quarters.  Today, Good Samaritan is more than a community hospital. A world-class academic medical center affiliated with the USC School of Medicine, Good Samaritan has 408 licensed beds. The hospital offers outstanding diagnostic, surgical and therapeutic care in a state-of-the-art setting. The main hospital, built in 1976, is seismic compliant. All patient rooms are private. VIP suites and valet parking are available.  Recognized as one of 'America's Best Hospitals for Top Medical Care in 16 Specialties' in 1998 by U.S. News &amp; World Report, Good Samaritan supports eight Centers of Excellence that focus on advancing the science of medicine while providing outstanding patient care. An acclaimed oncology program offers the widest range of options for gynecological, breast, brain and prostate cancers.   Each year, Good Samaritan admits approximately 18,000 patients and handles more than 91,600 outpatient visits. More than 6,550 surgeries are performed annually in 18 surgical suites.  A designated level II trauma center, Good Samaritan's Emergency Room handles more than 18,400 visits annually, with physicians on duty and a full-specialist panel on call.

The ranches were acquired between 1941 and 1952 by Fred C. Koch, co-founder of what is now Koch Industries. Today, the ranches total about 425,000 acres under management, including about 240,000 deeded acres. The ranches wean about 10,000 calves annually and support more than 15,000 cattle. The ranches stock Akaushi cattle whose beef is prized for its marbling and taste.     The Beaverhead uses a rest-rotation grazing plan developed in the 1970s that promotes biodiversity and healthier grazing. As a result, the ranch can support 8 percent more cattle while using 25 percent less supplemental feed. The ranch earned a Preservation Excellence Award from the Montana Preservation Alliance for preserving the historic character of its buildings. Interior walls that had to be replaced were kept, including one with signatures of cowboys dating back to the 1880s. In 2002, the ranch became the first ranch certified by the Wildlife Habitat Council for outstanding natural resource management initiatives, including re-establishing habitat for the Westslope cutthroat trout, increasing the number of elk and deer, and the diversity of plants.
